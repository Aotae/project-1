# UOCIS322 - Project 1 #

Nathan Pang
A simple web server which will serve files stored in it's docroot assuming pageserver.py is in the project greater directory and the docroot is a directory in the greater project directory.

For some reason __file__ didn't play nice with my debian distro so I specified the config file and for some reason that fixed it. Shared this information with Johnathan Star.
Literal black magic.

Worked with Johnathan Starlord and Henok Kidane on visualising the problem and reading python os documentation.
